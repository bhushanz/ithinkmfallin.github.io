## ANONYMOUS / HEY YOU
*_still confused in choosing the title_*

`cout<<“Hello World !!!”;`



Well, not that I’m a hardcore programmer but being a Software Engineer that’s the way I’m supposed to greet y’all as I’ve learned. In case you’re wondering what my name is, I just want you to know that it’s not important. I wish to be anonymous, at least for now. Maybe I have major self-confidence issues I don’t know. Even I don’t want this blog to be publicized because I don’t have enough confidence in my ablities as of yet and also because someone would anyway point out the grammarly mistakes in what I write (though they never seem to bother me, FYI my handritting is better than yours in case you’re being judgemental). I’m not a writer, a poet or a blogger. I’m just speaking my heart out. Whatever I’m writting is the exact same conversation I’m having with an imaginary person while drinking a cup of hot coffee and listening to some melancholic music (Melancholy is beautiful, isn’t it?). I’m not writting this to find out if I can write or not. But because I think I can write and everybody else can too. This blog is solely for the purpose of moulding various views and putting my own opinions into the topics that interests me while browsing through some social networking sites or scrolling through the stranger’s profile.

If you’re still reading this and want to know what I’m like, I’m a twenty something guy who smells like a teen spirit (mandatory **Nirvana** reference). I’m one of that (rarest) guy whom my friends always keep mocking for a fact that I’m not on the fbverse (dude, fb sucks *the sooner you realize*). I tweet a lot instead (safer place to cry). I hate photographs. I love blurred photos tho. I like to swim. I like to sketch. But I hate painting. I think brown is the new black. I don’t have a single hindi or a punjabi song in my playlist (the only thing I’m proud of myself). I once cried while listening to “To build a home” by The Cinematic Orchestra. If you watch football we’re more likely to become friends. I think I’m falling. In and out. And then right back in. I like to believe that I’m falling forward. I drink a lot of coffee and recently I’m battling my way through an obsessive consumption of caffeine. My heart is filled with the fog because I’ve not yet let go off the girl who have distant herself from me 4 years back. I haven’t yet watched the F.R.I.E.N.D.S. or GoT. I don’t follow the trends. I have my own taste and I’m on my own wave. To add more to the bio, I would say “DELHI SE HUN BEHNCHOD!!!!!”. I might literally bore you down if you spent more than 10 minutes talking with me. Unless I’m not SOBER. So in case you’re bored now you should know that it’s not my fault.

Hey that was about me. I would love it more to listen to your heart the same way you listened to mine.

Also I’m up for the good critics.

P.S.: This is not my first blog post which technically should be. This is the 5th something post which I wrote when I realized something need to be done to fill my hours and to prevent myself from sleeping.

Love,
Sincerely
